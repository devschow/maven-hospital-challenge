# 🏥 Power BI Hospital Analytics Dashboard – Maven Challenge

This project was created for the [Maven Analytics Hospital Challenge](https://mavenanalytics.io/challenges/maven-hospital-challenge/facee4d2-8369-4c87-a55e-e6c7ed2a42d8). The goal was to design a compelling and insightful **executive-level Power BI dashboard** for **Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH)** using patient and hospital encounter data.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Provide the MGH executive team with a clear, interactive view of **hospital performance**
- Track KPIs including:
  - Total admissions
  - Average cost per visit
  - Insurance coverage
  - Readmission rates
  - Most expensive procedures
- Deliver a scalable report to support **data-driven decision-making**

---

## 🧠 Business Context

MGH required a dashboard that would:
- Offer real-time visibility into patient flow, costs, and coverage
- Summarize trends across years (2011–2022)
- Be easily explorable by stakeholders using filters and slicers

To accomplish this, I:
- Connected multiple hospital datasets
- Designed a **data model** with appropriate relationships
- Built a KPI-driven interface using **Power BI best practices**
